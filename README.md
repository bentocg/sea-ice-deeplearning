# Context-aware sea ice extraction in high-res sea ice imagery with Deep Learning

### Contents:
* GUI for weak label extraction using a cascaded watershed segmentation algorithm
* PyTorch code for training a segmentation U-Net on sea ice labels

#TODO
* Use a pyramid of scales instead of simple panchromatic imagery
* Create inference pipeline
